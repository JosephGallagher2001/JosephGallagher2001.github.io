  <li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong>
    My primary computer platform is a Macbook Pro, MacOS Catalina 10.15.5
  </li>
  <li><strong>Courses I'm taking, and why:</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>BPT110 - This course seemed interesting, it was required for my degree, and I got to be exposed to a lot of methods of conveying a news story to the public. I was previously unaware of just how many communication methods there were in journalism.</li>
      <li>MAT110 - I mainly just took this because I needed to for my major, and I initially did not know what the point of having math skills for a broadcast major was, but I then learned that the point of having a math course in a broadcasting degree program was more about the critical problem solving aspect associated with mathematics than it was about the actual math operations.</li>
      <li>COM150 - I really wanted to have a basic understanding of public speaking, and since I'll be required to give information to the public, I need to learn the proper speaking technique if I want to deliver that information properly and not make a fool of myself by messing up my delivery of that information.</li>
      <li>PHI240 - I wanted to have a basic understanding of both the overall field of study that is ethics, and a knowledge of how that field of study applied to areas of our lives and our world as a whole. I figured that, in order to be a good broadcast journalist, I would need that knowledge of ethics, so I figured, "why not take this course and have that knowledge at my fingertips if I ever need it."</li>
      <li>WEB110 - I'm really just taking this course as an elective, I need it to eventually gain the required amount of credits in order to be considered a sophomore in college, but even though this isn't a required course for me, I am still enjoying the activities that we're doing. Here you will find my course contract: <a target="http://students.cpcc.edu/~jgallag5/web110/contract.html" href="http://students.cpcc.edu/~jgallag5/web110/contract.html">Course Contract</a>

  <li><strong>My academic background information:</strong>
    <br>
    Before going to central piedmont, I attended Queen's Grant high school, a community school in mint Hill, NC, where I spent my junior and senior years studying various areas of the academic world, and learning what was expected of me as a student. In addition to this, I made some friends, I was a part of the various campus activities offered by the school, got into a relationship (I won't bore you all with the details of that), made friends with both faculty and fellows students, and I was allowed to participate in various school-related activities.
    While I am not a straight-A student, I do you make decent grades, I never got below a D in a single college class last semester, which is quite impressive for me.
I graduated with a 3.1 grade-point-average in 2019, so I was obviously doing something right, and I have carred that success with me to college.
    I am sure you would like to know what the activities were which I participated in. I participated in my school's theater class, I was a member of the Latin class at my school, and I was even given the position of being the announcer for my school’s baseball team, albeit for only one season, during my senior year of high school. One of the advantages of the position I was given is that I was able to not only work on the projection of my voice (announcers have to use a very high pitch and excited tone when they are working at sports games), and, although my capabilities as the announcer were limited, I was still able to introduce the players as they individually walked up to the plate, and I even was able to announce who the pitcher was for my home team.
    (As a side note, I took this position for three reasons. One of those being that I had broken up with my girlfriend before the start of my senior year of high school, and I wanted something to take my mind off that experience. The second reason why I took this position is that I enjoyed being with the team and honing my craft of Voiceover/announcing. The third reason why I took this position is that I just enjoyed speaking and I felt this was a good avenue to pursue that.)</li>
<li><strong>My professional Information background:</strong>
  <br>
  I was the lector/announcer for the teen mass program at my church, from ninth grade up until 12th grade, after that, I aged out of the program. (although I was still a teenager at the time, the program was only available for ninth through 12th-grade students, and I was a new college student at the time that I exited the program)>
  I have voiced many different characters, both in school plays and productions, and when I was helping my father out with some characters for the audiobook version of one of his novels.</li>
<li><strong>My personal information/background:</strong>
  <br>
I am a 19-year-old boy from North Carolina. I've lived there all my life. In my free time, I enjoy watching TV, playing video games, hanging out with my family, and exercising. I enjoy creating characters in my free time, and I make these characters for different fandoms. I also enjoy, as I said earlier, playing video games and hanging out with my family. Those games include Minecraft, Raid: Shadow Legends, A game from the developer Socialpoint, called Monster Legends, Pokemon Go, and many others.</li> 
<li><strong>A fact to remember me by:</strong>
  <br>
When I was younger, in Elementary School actually, I had a crush, who's name I will not disclose, but even if I did disclose her name, she probably wouldn't care. Anyway, on with the fact. So I "dated" her starting in my second year of elementary, and going all the way until my fourth grade year, which was her fifth grade year, she was a year ahead of me. On the last day of her fifth grade year, I kissed her, but before I did, I told a buddy of mine by the name of Nick Lack to not tell anyone about what I was going to do. After my crush and I kissed, everyone on the school bus, which is where the kiss happened, saw it. Initially I was angry at Nick for telling everyone, but I soon realized that, if it's in public where you kiss your crush, then people will inevitably take notice, and so I really had no reason to get upset.</li>
<li><strong>I'd also like to share:</strong>
  <br>
Hello there, fellow scholars, my name is Joseph “Joe” Gallagher. I am a student at Central Piedmont community college, as I'm sure most, if not all of you are as well. When I was deciding on what major to declare, I looked back on my experiences with using my voice and communicating with people across various avenues and platforms.</li>
